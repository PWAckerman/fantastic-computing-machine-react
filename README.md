# Fantastic Computing Machine React
Rewriting the client side of my personal portfolio site with React + Redux.
May add some aesthetic improvements as well. The previous iteration was built in
Angular 1.x.

This is also built to potentially be extended into a general platform for
development portfolios in the future.

There is an accompanying Ionic application that I use to add microblog updates,
skills, and projects from my iPhone. I may rewrite that in React Native.

Additional technologies used in the stack or for building this project:

* Node.js
* Express & Hapi (server alternates between the two randomly)
* MongoDB & Mongoose ORM
* Redis (for caching)
* SendGrid
* Twilio
* WebPack
* Babel
* Cheerio (web scraping tool)

If I have time, I might rewrite the backend service with Elixir or Python.

Haven't started styling yet, but will most likely use Sass.
